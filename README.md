EcoCredit – Plastic Recycling Reward Management System (DBMS Project)

EcoCredit is a full-stack web application designed to promote plastic recycling by rewarding users with eco-credits based on the type and weight of plastic recycled. This project was developed as part of my Database Management Systems (DBMS) coursework, with a strong focus on SQL database design, backend integration, and role-based access control.

The system allows users to submit plastic recycling data, track earned credits, and redeem eco-friendly rewards, while administrators can verify submissions, manage approvals, and monitor overall recycling impact.

🔑 Key Features:

User & Admin authentication system

Plastic recycling submission with credit calculation (PET, HDPE, PVC, LDPE, PP, PS)

Admin approval/rejection workflow

Real-time credit balance tracking

Reward redemption system

Submission history and analytics dashboard

Role-based dashboards (User & Admin)

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js / Express.js

Database: MySQL (SQL)

Concepts: DBMS normalization, SQL queries, CRUD operations, joins, constraints

Authentication: Session-based login

Architecture: MVC-style separation

🎯 Learning Outcomes:

Designed and implemented a relational database schema

Integrated SQL database with backend APIs

Applied DBMS concepts in a real-world use case

Built secure role-based access systems

Developed a complete end-to-end application

This project demonstrates my ability to apply DBMS theory into practical, real-world software solutions with a focus on sustainability and impact.<img width="1918" height="1020" alt="dbms1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eff372ac-8d00-40c4-83ad-1c28d5058344" />
